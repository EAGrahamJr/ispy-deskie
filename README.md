# Yet Another HomeControl Thingie

This one has an SSD1306, a gesture sensor, and an "environment" sensor.

What's different from all the other projects (thus far) is this one is _entirely in Python_. Full Adafruit CircuitPython
libraries and all.

(tbh, `asyncio` is pretty good for what it's doing)
